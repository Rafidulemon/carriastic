1) Global Website Chatbot (Main Layout)

Objective
Deploy a persistent chatbot accessible from the global website layout, capable of answering questions related to Carriastic’s company profile, offerings, process, and policies using the website content plus an approved company profile PDF as the primary knowledge source.

Scope & Capabilities

Respond to all queries about:

Company overview, mission, positioning, services, engagement model

Core AI capabilities (GenAI, RAG, agentic AI, automation)

FAQs, policies, general customer queries

Ground responses using:

Website pages (structured content)

A designated company profile PDF as a controlled knowledge source

Provide citations (“Sources”) linking to:

Relevant website pages

PDF section references (page/section identifiers)

Recommended Approach

Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:

Content ingestion: site content + approved PDF

Chunking + embedding + vector index

Answer generation constrained to retrieved sources (“grounded responses”)

Add system-level controls:

Refuse unsupported requests (“I don’t have enough info from official sources”)

Avoid fabricating claims, policies, numbers, or clients

2) Career Page Chatbot (Hiring & Job Openings)

Objective
Provide a dedicated chatbot on the Careers page to answer questions about hiring, open roles, job responsibilities, requirements, benefits (if published), and the hiring process.

Scope & Capabilities

Respond only to career-related queries:

Current job openings and role details

Hiring stages, interview format, expected timelines

Application instructions, eligibility, and FAQs

Data sources (authoritative):

The live job openings dataset (CMS/DB/API)

Hiring process documentation published on the site

Must reflect real-time accuracy:

When a job is closed/updated, responses reflect the current state

Recommended Approach

RAG + structured data hybrid:

Retrieve from “Open roles” structured source first (single source of truth)

Use RAG to answer policy/process questions from career documentation

Include “Apply Now” / “Human support” routing:

Link to application page/form

“Talk to HR” escalation path if questions fall outside published info

3) Projects Page Chatbot (Project-Specific Assistant)

Objective
Enable a chatbot within Projects pages that answers questions about a specific project, including features, outcomes, stack, responsibilities, timeline (only if public), and relevant links.

Scope & Capabilities

Contextual awareness:

The chatbot must be scoped to the currently viewed project

Sources:

The project’s own page content and metadata

Approved project documentation (if published)

Related case study pages

Safeguards:

Must not disclose confidential client or internal information

Must not invent technical claims not present in sources

Recommended Approach

Context-bound RAG:

When user is on a specific project page, retrieval is restricted to that project’s knowledge base

Offer “View sources” links to project sections/case studies used

4) Central “Client Needs” Chatbot (Solution Recommendation & Qualification)

Objective
Deploy a central chatbot focused on determining what type of software or solution a prospective client may need, and guiding them toward the correct engagement path.

Scope & Capabilities

Conduct interactive discovery:

Industry, goals, current pain points

Existing tools and systems

Expected users, workflows, integrations

Timeline and budget range (high-level only)

Output:

A recommended solution direction (e.g., automation, custom platform, AI enablement, RAG assistant, internal systems)

A high-level roadmap and next steps

Option to generate a “Project Brief” summary for submission

Routing:

Direct the lead to the correct service category and contact path

Escalate to human consultation when complexity is high

Recommended Approach

Guided agentic flow (structured interview + LLM reasoning)

Guardrails to avoid “fake certainty”:

Provide ranges and assumptions

Clearly separate “recommendation” vs “confirmed scope”

Safety, Quality, and Trust Requirements (Mandatory)
A) Source-Grounded Answers

Every factual answer must include Sources:

Website links for public content

PDF citation (page/section reference)

If no source supports a claim, the assistant must:

Say it does not have sufficient information

Offer a human handoff or suggest where the user can find the information

B) Clear Disclaimer

A consistent disclaimer must be visible (or shown on first interaction), such as:
“Responses may be inaccurate—please confirm with our team for final decisions or estimates.”

C) Human Handoff

Provide a persistent action:
“Talk to a specialist”
This should route to:

Contact form

Sales/support email

Meeting scheduling link (if available)

D) Pricing Controls

The assistant must not provide definitive pricing.

Allowed behavior:

Use ranges only (if officially published)

Otherwise: “Pricing depends on scope—talk to our team for a quote.”
